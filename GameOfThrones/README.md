Game of Thrones dataset
=======================

This is a small dataset of characters from the novel and fantasy drama television
series Game of Thrones (as of season 1). It includes character traits in two
languages, some family relations, and a small set of filming locations.

See the [AQL tutorial](https://docs.arangodb.com/latest/AQL/Tutorial/) for queries.

To create the necessary collections with indexes, import the JSON data and create
a named graph for visualization purposes, run the `import.js` script with arangosh.
