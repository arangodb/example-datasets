wikiimporter
============

wikiimporter is a converter for Wikipedia dumps written by Sebastian
Cohnen in Ruby, see https://github.com/tisba/wikiimporter. Downloading
the wikipedia dump will take some time - it is roughly 2.5 GByte.

    cd wikiimporter
    mkdir data
    mkdir log

    sudo bundle install

    curl `./bin/getlatestdumpurl.rb` -o data/wiki.xml.bz2 
    bzcat data/wiki.xml.bz2 | ./bin/wikixml2json.rb --max-pages 10000 > data/articles.json

    arangoimp --file data/articles.json --collection=wiki --create-collection=true --type=json

NerdPursuit
===========

See https://github.com/Nerds/NerdPursuit for details. Each question is
stored in its own file. So, you must create a file with all questions
first:

    ./nerd_pursuit_compress.sh

and then import the generated file using

    arangoimp --file nerd_pursuit_compressed.json --collection=nerds --create-collection=true --type=json


IP Address Ranges
=================

The IPRanges directory contains IP address ranges and geo
information. There are 3.7 Million ranges.

    {
      "locId" : "17",
      "endIpNum" : "16777471",
      "startIpNum" : "16777216", 
      "geo" : [ -27, 133 ] 
    }

In order to import these locations, use:

    arangoimp --file geoblocks.json --collection=ip_ranges --create-collection=true --type=json


The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography
======================================

Download the data

    ./dblp-download.sh

this will create an XML file dblp.xml (roughly 1.1 GByte).

    python dblp2json.py dblp.xml > dblp.json

converts the file to json


Graphs Airline Company
=====================

The Graphs/AirlineCompany directory contains a subset of the Airports and flight routes of an imaginary airline company among them.
Most of the flights are starting from Cologne Airport (CGN).

In order to import this data use
  
```
  unix> arangorestore --input-directory "<path-to>/AirlineCompany"
```

If you want to create a graph for this data use

```
  unix> arangosh
  arangosh> var Graph = require("org/arangodb/graph").Graph;
  arangosh> new Graph("Airline", "airports", "flights");
```

Graphs IMDB
====================

The Graphs/IMDB contains a dataset taken form IMDB http://www.imdb.com.

In order to import this data execute the following command:
```Bash
  unix> arangosh
  arangosh> require("internal").load("Graphs/IMDB/import.js");
```
This dataset has been used for the [screencast of the graph visualisation tool](https://www.arangodb.com/2013/11/29/visualize-graphs-screencast).


Debian Dependency Graph
========================

The [debian linux distribution](http://debian.org) consists of packages, which relate to each others by dependencies, which demand or recommend other packages to be installed.
Also conflicts are a possible relation, which prohibits two packages to be installed at once.
The script used to [gather this graph data is available alongside with pyarango](https://github.com/tariqdaouda/pyArango/blob/master/examples/debiangraph.py).
However, it takes a while to translate the debian package database into arangodb documents, so here is a dump of the Debian Jessie package database.

Since this is a dump of a complete database, you can use [`arangorestore`](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/programs-arangorestore.html) to import this. We will create an own database `debianGraph` so it doesn't interfere with your existing data:


```
unix> arangorestore --input-directory DebianDependencyGraph/ \
    --create-collection true \
    --include-system-collections true \
    --create-database true \
    --server.database debianGraph
```

Using the [ArangoDB graph viewer](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb), we can browse random starting points in the graph:

Small, multi-purpose dataset including a small graph of parents and children (`Characters --ChildOf--> Characters`).
See [README](GameOfThrones/README.md) for details.

Amazon Meta
===========

Amazon product co-purchasing network metadata (summer 2006) with product
metadata for over half a million different products from different categories:
